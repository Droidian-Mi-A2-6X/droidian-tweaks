# Drodian Tweaks

These tweaks are specifically for jasmine/wayne. At some point these fixes should be turned into device adaptation. Running `setup.sh` file fixes the following bugs:

1. Brightness (You should disable automatic brightness from settings>power in gnome settings)
2. Bluetooth
3. Scaling

The `setup.sh` script additionally installs and enables flathub and kdeapps flathub repos as well.
